### About me

Hi, **I am Marcus** ðŸš€.

Software Engineer, Security Disciple and CEO of Sojourner Development. I am 22 years old and based in Tyrol, Austria.

My areas of expertise are
 * Project Management
 * Software Engineering
 * Cybersecurity and especially Software Security
 * Modern and goal-oriented UI/UX Design
 * Photography

For many years I have been developing security solutions and productivity software with a focus on functionality, design and performance.

Most of the software I develop is shielded from the public via my custom Software Center for customers to access, or via the licenses that can be purchased through Sojourner Development.

Furthermore, I am sometimes available for partner projects that inspire me. Here on Github (in the public area) you can find sadly still few things, because most security tools and applications are not open source. In the future I will add more stuff here.

You can contact me about my products or to simply have a chat at marcus@sdev-software.com.
